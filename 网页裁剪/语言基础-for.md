The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.  
See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.  
See [JDK Release Notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk-relnotes-index-2162236.html) for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.

## The for Statement

The `for` statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. Programmers often refer to it as the "for loop" because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied. The general form of the `for` statement can be expressed as follows:

```
for (initialization; termination;
     increment) {
    statement(s)
}
```

When using this version of the `for` statement, keep in mind that:

- The *initialization* expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
- When the *termination* expression evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates.
- The *increment* expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment *or* decrement a value.

The following program, [`ForDemo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/ForDemo.java), uses the general form of the `for` statement to print the numbers 1 through 10 to standard output:

```java
class ForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         for(int i=1; i<11; i++){
              System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
         }
    }
}
```

The output of this program is:

```
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10
```

Notice how the code declares a variable within the initialization expression. The scope of this variable extends from its declaration to the end of the block governed by the `for` statement, so it can be used in the termination and increment expressions as well. If the variable that controls a `for` statement is not needed outside of the loop, it's best to declare the variable in the initialization expression. The names `i`, `j`, and `k` are often used to control `for` loops; declaring them within the initialization expression limits their life span and reduces errors.

The three expressions of the `for` loop are optional; an infinite loop can be created as follows:

```
// infinite loop
for ( ; ; ) {
    
    // your code goes here
}
```

The `for` statement also has another form designed for iteration through [[集合|Collections]] and [[语言基础-arrays|arrays]] This form is sometimes referred to as the *enhanced for* statement, and can be used to make your loops more compact and easy to read. To demonstrate, consider the following array, which holds the numbers 1 through 10:

```
int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
```

The following program, [`EnhancedForDemo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/EnhancedForDemo.java), uses the enhanced `for` to loop through the array:

```java
class EnhancedForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         int[] numbers = 
             {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
         for (int item : numbers) {
             System.out.println("Count is: " + item);
         }
    }
}
```

In this example, the variable `item` holds the current value from the numbers array. The output from this program is the same as before:

```
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10
```

We recommend using this form of the `for` statement instead of the general form whenever possible.
