## Declaring Member Variables

There are several kinds of variables:

- Member variables in a class—these are called *fields*.
- Variables in a method or block of code—these are called *local variables*.
- Variables in method declarations—these are called *parameters*.

The `Bicycle` class uses the following lines of code to define its fields:

```
public int cadence;
public int gear;
public int speed;
```

Field declarations are composed of three components, in order:

1. Zero or more modifiers, such as `public` or `private`.
2. The field's type.
3. The field's name.

The fields of `Bicycle` are named `cadence`, `gear`, and `speed` and are all of data type integer (`int`). The `public` keyword identifies these fields as public members, accessible by any object that can access the class.

## Access Modifiers

The first (left-most) modifier used lets you control what other classes have access to a member field. For the moment, consider only `public` and `private`. Other access modifiers will be discussed later.

- `public` modifier—the field is accessible from all classes.
- `private` modifier—the field is accessible only within its own class.

In the spirit of encapsulation, it is common to make fields private. This means that they can only be *directly* accessed from the Bicycle class. We still need access to these values, however. This can be done *indirectly* by adding public methods that obtain the field values for us:

```
public class Bicycle {
        
    private int cadence;
    private int gear;
    private int speed;
        
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }
        
    public int getCadence() {
        return cadence;
    }
        
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
        
    public int getGear() {
        return gear;
    }
        
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
        
    public int getSpeed() {
        return speed;
    }
        
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
        
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
}
```

## Types

All variables must have a type. You can use primitive types such as `int`, `float`, `boolean`, etc. Or you can use reference types, such as strings, arrays, or objects.

## Variable Names

All variables, whether they are fields, local variables, or parameters, follow the same naming rules and conventions that were covered in the Language Basics lesson, [Variables—Naming](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html#naming).

In this lesson, be aware that the same naming rules and conventions are used for method and class names, except that

- the first letter of a class name should be capitalized, and
- the first (or only) word in a method name should be a verb.
