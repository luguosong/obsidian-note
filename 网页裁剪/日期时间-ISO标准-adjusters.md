The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.  
See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.  
See [JDK Release Notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk-relnotes-index-2162236.html) for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.

## Temporal Adjuster

The [TemporalAdjuster](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/TemporalAdjuster.html) interface, in the java.time.temporal package, provides methods that take a Temporal value and return an adjusted value. The adjusters can be used with any of the temporal-based types.

If an adjuster is used with a ZonedDateTime, then a new date is computed that preserves the original time and time zone values.

## Predefined Adjusters

The [TemporalAdjusters](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/TemporalAdjusters.html) class (note the plural) provides a set of predefined adjusters for finding the first or last day of the month, the first or last day of the year, the last Wednesday of the month, or the first Tuesday after a specific date, to name a few examples. The predefined adjusters are defined as static methods and are designed to be used with the [[包-usepkgs|static import]] statement.

The following example uses several TemporalAdjusters methods, in conjunction with the with method defined in the temporal-based classes, to compute new dates based on the original date of 15 October 2000:

```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2000, Month.OCTOBER, 15);
DayOfWeek dotw = date.getDayOfWeek();
System.out.printf("%s is on a %s%n", date, dotw);

System.out.printf("first day of Month: %s%n",
                  date.with(TemporalAdjusters.firstDayOfMonth()));
System.out.printf("first Monday of Month: %s%n",
                  date.with(TemporalAdjusters.firstInMonth(DayOfWeek.MONDAY)));
System.out.printf("last day of Month: %s%n",
                  date.with(TemporalAdjusters.lastDayOfMonth()));
System.out.printf("first day of next Month: %s%n",
                  date.with(TemporalAdjusters.firstDayOfNextMonth()));
System.out.printf("first day of next Year: %s%n",
                  date.with(TemporalAdjusters.firstDayOfNextYear()));
System.out.printf("first day of Year: %s%n",
                  date.with(TemporalAdjusters.firstDayOfYear()));
```text

This produces the following output:

```
2000-10-15 is on a SUNDAY
first day of Month: 2000-10-01
first Monday of Month: 2000-10-02
last day of Month: 2000-10-31
first day of next Month: 2000-11-01
first day of next Year: 2001-01-01
first day of Year: 2000-01-01
```java

## Custom Adjusters

You can also create your own custom adjuster. To do this, you create a class that implements the TemporalAdjuster interface with a [adjustInto(Temporal)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/TemporalAdjuster.html#adjustInto-java.time.temporal.Temporal-) method. The [`PaydayAdjuster`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/examples/PaydayAdjuster.java) class from the [`NextPayday`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/examples/NextPayday.java) example is a custom adjuster. The PaydayAdjuster evaluates the passed-in date and returns the next payday, assuming that payday occurs twice a month: on the 15th, and again on the last day of the month. If the computed date occurs on a weekend, then the previous Friday is used. The current calendar year is assumed.

```bash
/**
 * The adjustInto method accepts a Temporal instance 
 * and returns an adjusted LocalDate. If the passed in
 * parameter is not a LocalDate, then a DateTimeException is thrown.
 */
public Temporal adjustInto(Temporal input) {
    LocalDate date = LocalDate.from(input);
    int day;
    if (date.getDayOfMonth() < 15) {
        day = 15;
    } else {
        day = date.with(TemporalAdjusters.lastDayOfMonth()).getDayOfMonth();
    }
    date = date.withDayOfMonth(day);
    if (date.getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.SATURDAY ||
        date.getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.SUNDAY) {
        date = date.with(TemporalAdjusters.previous(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY));
    }

    return input.with(date);
}
```

The adjuster is invoked in the same manner as a predefined adjuster, using the with method. The following line of code is from the NextPayday example:

```text
LocalDate nextPayday = date.with(new PaydayAdjuster());
```

In 2013, both June 15 and June 30 occur on the weekend. Running the NextPayday example with the respective dates of June 3 and June 18 (in 2013), gives the following results:

```text
Given the date:  2013 Jun 3
the next payday: 2013 Jun 14

Given the date:  2013 Jun 18
the next payday: 2013 Jun 28
```
