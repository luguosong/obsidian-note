## Bean Customization

*Customization* provides a means for modifying the appearance and behavior of a bean within an application builder so it meets your specific needs. There are several levels of customization available for a bean developer to allow other developers to get maximum benefit from a bean's potential functionality.

The following links are useful for learning about property editors and customizers:

- [`PropertyEditor`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditor.html) interface
- [`PropertyEditorSupport`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditorSupport.html) class
- [`PropertyEditorManager`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditorManager.html) class
- [`Customizer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Customizer.html) interface
- [`BeanInfo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html) interface

A bean's appearance and behavior can be customized at design time within beans-compliant builder tools. There are two ways to customize a bean:

- By using a *property editor*. Each bean property has its own property editor. The NetBeans GUI Builder usually displays a bean's property editors in the Properties window. The property editor that is associated with a particular property type edits that property type.
- By using *customizers*. Customizers give you complete GUI control over bean customization. Customizers are used where property editors are not practical or applicable. Unlike a property editor, which is associated with a property, a customizer is associated with a bean.

## Property Editors

A property editor is a tool for customizing a particular property type. Property editors are activated in the Properties window. This window determines a property's type, searches for a relevant property editor, and displays the property's current value in a relevant way.

Property editors must implement the `PropertyEditor` interface, which provides methods to specify how a property should be displayed in a property sheet. The following figure represents the Properties window containing `myBean1` properties:

![[JavaBeans--Bean-customization.gif]]

You begin the process of editing these properties by clicking the property entry. Clicking most of these entries will bring up separate panels. For example, to set up the `foreground` or `background` use selection boxes with choices of colors, or press the "..." button to work with a standard ColorEditor window. Clicking on the `toolTipText` property opens a StringEditor window.

The support class `PropertyEditorSupport` provides a default implementation of the `PropertyEditor` interface. By subclassing your property editor from `PropertyEditorSupport`, you can simply override the methods you need.

To display the current property value "sample" within the Properties window, you need to override `isPaintable` to return `true`. You then must override `paintValue` to paint the current property value in a rectangle in the property sheet. Here's how `ColorEditor` implements `paintValue`:

```java
public void paintValue(java.awt.Graphics gfx, java.awt.Rectangle box) {
    Color oldColor = gfx.getColor();
    gfx.setColor(Color.black);
    gfx.drawRect(box.x, box.y, box.width-3, box.height-3);
    gfx.setColor(color);
    gfx.fillRect(box.x+1, box.y+1, box.width-4, box.height-4);
    gfx.setColor(oldColor);
}

To support the custom property editor, override two more methods. Override `supportsCustomEditor` to return true, and then override `getCustomEditor` to return a custom editor instance. `ColorEditor.getCustomEditor` returns `this`.

In addition, the `PropertyEditorSupport` class maintains a `PropertyChangeListener` list, and fires property change event notifications to those listeners when a bound property is changed.

## How Property Editors are Associated with Properties

Property editors are discovered and associated with a given property in the following ways:

- Explicit association by way of a `BeanInfo` object. The editor of the title's property is set with the following line of code:
	pd.setPropertyEditorClass(TitleEditor.class);
	```
- Explicit registration by way of the `java.beans.PropertyEditorManager.registerEditor` method. This method takes two arguments: the bean class type, and the editor class to be associated with that type.
- Name search. If a class has no explicitly associated property editor, then the `PropertyEditorManager` searches for that class's property editor in the following ways:
	- Appending "Editor" to the fully qualified class name. For example, for the `my.package.ComplexNumber` class, the property editor manager would search for the `my.package.ComplexNumberEditor` class.
		- Appending "Editor" to the class name and searching a class path.

## Customizers

You have learned that builder tools provide support for you to create your own property editors. What other needs should visual builders meet for complex, industrial-strength beans? Often it is undesirable to have all the properties of a bean revealed on a single (sometimes huge) property sheet. What if one single root choice about the type of the bean rendered half the properties irrelevant? The JavaBeans specification provides for user-defined customizers, through which you can define a higher level of customization for bean properties than is available with property editors.

When you use a bean *Customizer*, you have complete control over how to configure or edit a bean. A Customizer is an application that specifically targets a bean's customization. Sometimes properties are insufficient for representing a bean's configurable attributes. Customizers are used where sophisticated instructions would be needed to change a bean, and where property editors are too primitive to achieve bean customization.

All customizers must:

- Extend `java.awt.Component` or one of its subclasses.
- Implement the `java.beans.Customizer` interface This means implementing methods to register `PropertyChangeListener` objects, and firing property change events at those listeners when a change to the target bean has occurred.
- Implement a default constructor.
- Associate the customizer with its target class via `BeanInfo.getBeanDescriptor`.
