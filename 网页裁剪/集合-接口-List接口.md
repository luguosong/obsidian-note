## The List Interface

A [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) is an ordered [`Collection`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) (sometimes called a *sequence*). Lists may contain duplicate elements. In addition to the operations inherited from `Collection`, the `List` interface includes operations for the following:

- `Positional access` — manipulates elements based on their numerical position in the list. This includes methods such as `get`, `set`, `add`, `addAll`, and `remove`.
- `Search` — searches for a specified object in the list and returns its numerical position. Search methods include `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf`.
- `Iteration` — extends `Iterator` semantics to take advantage of the list's sequential nature. The `listIterator` methods provide this behavior.
- `Range-view` — The `sublist` method performs arbitrary *range operations* on the list.

The Java platform contains two general-purpose `List` implementations. [`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html), which is usually the better-performing implementation, and [`LinkedList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) which offers better performance under certain circumstances.

## Collection Operations

The operations inherited from `Collection` all do about what you'd expect them to do, assuming you're already familiar with them. If you're not familiar with them from `Collection`, now would be a good time to read [[集合-接口-Collection接口|The Collection Interface]] section. The `remove` operation always removes *the first* occurrence of the specified element from the list. The `add` and `addAll` operations always append the new element(s) to the *end* of the list. Thus, the following idiom concatenates one list to another.

```
list1.addAll(list2);
```

Here's a nondestructive form of this idiom, which produces a third `List` consisting of the second list appended to the first.

```
List<Type> list3 = new ArrayList<Type>(list1);
list3.addAll(list2);
```

Note that the idiom, in its nondestructive form, takes advantage of `ArrayList` 's standard conversion constructor.

And here's an example (JDK 8 and later) that aggregates some names into a `List`:

```
List<String> list = people.stream()
.map(Person::getName)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Like the [`Set`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html) interface, `List` strengthens the requirements on the `equals` and `hashCode` methods so that two `List` objects can be compared for logical equality without regard to their implementation classes. Two `List` objects are equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.

## Positional Access and Search Operations

The basic `positional access` operations are `get`, `set`, `add` and `remove`. (The `set` and `remove` operations return the old value that is being overwritten or removed.) Other operations (`indexOf` and `lastIndexOf`) return the first or last index of the specified element in the list.

The `addAll` operation inserts all the elements of the specified `Collection` starting at the specified position. The elements are inserted in the order they are returned by the specified `Collection` 's iterator. This call is the positional access analog of `Collection` 's `addAll` operation.

Here's a little method to swap two indexed values in a `List`.

```batch
public static <E> void swap(List<E> a, int i, int j) {
    E tmp = a.get(i);
    a.set(i, a.get(j));
    a.set(j, tmp);
}
```

Of course, there's one big difference. This is a polymorphic algorithm: It swaps two elements in any `List`, regardless of its implementation type. Here's another polymorphic algorithm that uses the preceding `swap` method.

```java
public static void shuffle(List<?> list, Random rnd) {
    for (int i = list.size(); i > 1; i--)
        swap(list, i - 1, rnd.nextInt(i));
}
```

This algorithm, which is included in the Java platform's [`Collections`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html) class, randomly permutes the specified list using the specified source of randomness. It's a bit subtle: It runs up the list from the bottom, repeatedly swapping a randomly selected element into the current position. Unlike most naive attempts at shuffling, it's *fair* (all permutations occur with equal likelihood, assuming an unbiased source of randomness) and *fast* (requiring exactly `list.size()-1` swaps). The following program uses this algorithm to print the words in its argument list in random order.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Shuffle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        for (String a : args)
            list.add(a);
        Collections.shuffle(list, new Random());
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

In fact, this program can be made even shorter and faster. The [`Arrays`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html) class has a static factory method called `asList`, which allows an array to be viewed as a `List`. This method does not copy the array. Changes in the `List` write through to the array and vice versa. The resulting List is not a general-purpose `List` implementation, because it doesn't implement the (optional) `add` and `remove` operations: Arrays are not resizable. Taking advantage of `Arrays.asList` and calling the library version of `shuffle`, which uses a default source of randomness, you get the following [`tiny program`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/examples/Shuffle.java) whose behavior is identical to the previous program.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Shuffle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList(args);
        Collections.shuffle(list);
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

## Iterators

As you'd expect, the `Iterator` returned by `List` 's `iterator` operation returns the elements of the list in proper sequence. `List` also provides a richer iterator, called a `ListIterator`, which allows you to traverse the list in either direction, modify the list during iteration, and obtain the current position of the iterator.

The three methods that `ListIterator` inherits from `Iterator` (`hasNext`, `next`, and `remove`) do exactly the same thing in both interfaces. The `hasPrevious` and the `previous` operations are exact analogues of `hasNext` and `next`. The former operations refer to the element before the (implicit) cursor, whereas the latter refer to the element after the cursor. The `previous` operation moves the cursor backward, whereas `next` moves it forward.

Here's the standard idiom for iterating backward through a list.

```
for (ListIterator<Type> it = list.listIterator(list.size()); it.hasPrevious(); ) {
    Type t = it.previous();
    ...
}
```

Note the argument to `listIterator` in the preceding idiom. The `List` interface has two forms of the `listIterator` method. The form with no arguments returns a `ListIterator` positioned at the beginning of the list; the form with an `int` argument returns a `ListIterator` positioned at the specified index. The index refers to the element that would be returned by an initial call to `next`. An initial call to `previous` would return the element whose index was `index-1`. In a list of length `n`, there are `n+1` valid values for `index`, from `0` to `n`, inclusive.

Intuitively speaking, the cursor is always between two elements — the one that would be returned by a call to `previous` and the one that would be returned by a call to `next`. The `n+1` valid `index` values correspond to the `n+1` gaps between elements, from the gap before the first element to the gap after the last one. The following figure shows the five possible cursor positions in a list containing four elements.

![[--List-colls-fivePossibleCursor.gif]]

The five possible cursor positions.

Calls to `next` and `previous` can be intermixed, but you have to be a bit careful. The first call to `previous` returns the same element as the last call to `next`. Similarly, the first call to `next` after a sequence of calls to `previous` returns the same element as the last call to `previous`.

It should come as no surprise that the `nextIndex` method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to `next`, and `previousIndex` returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to `previous`. These calls are typically used either to report the position where something was found or to record the position of the `ListIterator` so that another `ListIterator` with identical position can be created.

It should also come as no surprise that the number returned by `nextIndex` is always one greater than the number returned by `previousIndex`. This implies the behavior of the two boundary cases: (1) a call to `previousIndex` when the cursor is before the initial element returns `-1` and (2) a call to `nextIndex` when the cursor is after the final element returns `list.size()`. To make all this concrete, the following is a possible implementation of `List.indexOf`.

```bash
public int indexOf(E e) {
    for (ListIterator<E> it = listIterator(); it.hasNext(); )
        if (e == null ? it.next() == null : e.equals(it.next()))
            return it.previousIndex();
    // Element not found
    return -1;
}
```

Note that the `indexOf` method returns `it.previousIndex()` even though it is traversing the list in the forward direction. The reason is that `it.nextIndex()` would return the index of the element we are about to examine, and we want to return the index of the element we just examined.

The `Iterator` interface provides the `remove` operation to remove the last element returned by `next` from the `Collection`. For `ListIterator`, this operation removes the last element returned by `next` or `previous`. The `ListIterator` interface provides two additional operations to modify the list — `set` and `add`. The `set` method overwrites the last element returned by `next` or `previous` with the specified element. The following polymorphic algorithm uses `set` to replace all occurrences of one specified value with another.

```batch
public static <E> void replace(List<E> list, E val, E newVal) {
    for (ListIterator<E> it = list.listIterator(); it.hasNext(); )
        if (val == null ? it.next() == null : val.equals(it.next()))
            it.set(newVal);
}
```

The only bit of trickiness in this example is the equality test between `val` and `it.next`. You need to special-case a `val` value of `null` to prevent a `NullPointerException`.

The `add` method inserts a new element into the list immediately before the current cursor position. This method is illustrated in the following polymorphic algorithm to replace all occurrences of a specified value with the sequence of values contained in the specified list.

```
public static <E> 
    void replace(List<E> list, E val, List<? extends E> newVals) {
    for (ListIterator<E> it = list.listIterator(); it.hasNext(); ){
        if (val == null ? it.next() == null : val.equals(it.next())) {
            it.remove();
            for (E e : newVals)
                it.add(e);
        }
    }
}
```

## Range-View Operation

The `range-view` operation, `subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex)`, returns a `List` view of the portion of this list whose indices range from `fromIndex`, inclusive, to `toIndex`, exclusive. This *half-open range* mirrors the typical `for` loop.

```
for (int i = fromIndex; i < toIndex; i++) {
    ...
}
```

As the term *view* implies, the returned `List` is backed up by the `List` on which `subList` was called, so changes in the former are reflected in the latter.

This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects a `List` can be used as a range operation by passing a `subList` view instead of a whole `List`. For example, the following idiom removes a range of elements from a `List`.

```
list.subList(fromIndex, toIndex).clear();
```

Similar idioms can be constructed to search for an element in a range.

```
int i = list.subList(fromIndex, toIndex).indexOf(o);
int j = list.subList(fromIndex, toIndex).lastIndexOf(o);
```

Note that the preceding idioms return the index of the found element in the `subList`, not the index in the backing `List`.

Any polymorphic algorithm that operates on a `List`, such as the `replace` and `shuffle` examples, works with the `List` returned by `subList`.

Here's a polymorphic algorithm whose implementation uses `subList` to deal a hand from a deck. That is, it returns a new `List` (the "hand") containing the specified number of elements taken from the end of the specified `List` (the "deck"). The elements returned in the hand are removed from the deck.

```
public static <E> List<E> dealHand(List<E> deck, int n) {
    int deckSize = deck.size();
    List<E> handView = deck.subList(deckSize - n, deckSize);
    List<E> hand = new ArrayList<E>(handView);
    handView.clear();
    return hand;
}
```

Note that this algorithm removes the hand from the *end* of the deck. For many common `List` implementations, such as `ArrayList`, the performance of removing elements from the end of the list is substantially better than that of removing elements from the beginning.

The following is [`a program`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/examples/Deal.java) that uses the `dealHand` method in combination with `Collections.shuffle` to generate hands from a normal 52-card deck. The program takes two command-line arguments: (1) the number of hands to deal and (2) the number of cards in each hand.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Deal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length < 2) {
            System.out.println("Usage: Deal hands cards");
            return;
        }
        int numHands = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int cardsPerHand = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    
        // Make a normal 52-card deck.
        String[] suit = new String[] {
            "spades", "hearts", 
            "diamonds", "clubs" 
        };
        String[] rank = new String[] {
            "ace", "2", "3", "4",
            "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", 
            "jack", "queen", "king" 
        };

        List<String> deck = new ArrayList<String>();
        for (int i = 0; i < suit.length; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < rank.length; j++)
                deck.add(rank[j] + " of " + suit[i]);
    
        // Shuffle the deck.
        Collections.shuffle(deck);
    
        if (numHands * cardsPerHand > deck.size()) {
            System.out.println("Not enough cards.");
            return;
        }
    
        for (int i = 0; i < numHands; i++)
            System.out.println(dealHand(deck, cardsPerHand));
    }
  
    public static <E> List<E> dealHand(List<E> deck, int n) {
        int deckSize = deck.size();
        List<E> handView = deck.subList(deckSize - n, deckSize);
        List<E> hand = new ArrayList<E>(handView);
        handView.clear();
        return hand;
    }
}
```

Running the program produces output like the following.

```
% java Deal 4 5

[8 of hearts, jack of spades, 3 of spades, 4 of spades,
    king of diamonds]
[4 of diamonds, ace of clubs, 6 of clubs, jack of hearts,
    queen of hearts]
[7 of spades, 5 of spades, 2 of diamonds, queen of diamonds,
    9 of clubs]
[8 of spades, 6 of diamonds, ace of spades, 3 of hearts,
    ace of hearts]
```

Although the `subList` operation is extremely powerful, some care must be exercised when using it. The semantics of the `List` returned by `subList` become undefined if elements are added to or removed from the backing `List` in any way other than via the returned `List`. Thus, it's highly recommended that you use the `List` returned by `subList` only as a transient object — to perform one or a sequence of range operations on the backing `List`. The longer you use the `subList` instance, the greater the probability that you'll compromise it by modifying the backing `List` directly or through another `subList` object. Note that it is legal to modify a sublist of a sublist and to continue using the original sublist (though not concurrently).

## List Algorithms

Most polymorphic algorithms in the `Collections` class apply specifically to `List`. Having all these algorithms at your disposal makes it very easy to manipulate lists. Here's a summary of these algorithms, which are described in more detail in the [[集合-算法|Algorithms]] section.

- `sort` — sorts a `List` using a merge sort algorithm, which provides a fast, stable sort. (A *stable sort* is one that does not reorder equal elements.)
- `shuffle` — randomly permutes the elements in a `List`.
- `reverse` — reverses the order of the elements in a `List`.
- `rotate` — rotates all the elements in a `List` by a specified distance.
- `swap` — swaps the elements at specified positions in a `List`.
- `replaceAll` — replaces all occurrences of one specified value with another.
- `fill` — overwrites every element in a `List` with the specified value.
- `copy` — copies the source `List` into the destination `List`.
- `binarySearch` — searches for an element in an ordered `List` using the binary search algorithm.
- `indexOfSubList` — returns the index of the first sublist of one `List` that is equal to another.
- `lastIndexOfSubList` — returns the index of the last sublist of one `List` that is equal to another.
