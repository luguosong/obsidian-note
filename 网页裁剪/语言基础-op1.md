See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.

## Assignment, Arithmetic, and Unary Operators

## The Simple Assignment Operator

One of the most common operators that you'll encounter is the simple assignment operator " `=` ". You saw this operator in the Bicycle class; it assigns the value on its right to the operand on its left:

```
int cadence = 0;
int speed = 0;
int gear = 1;
```

This operator can also be used on objects to assign *object references*, as discussed in [[类与对象-objectcreation|Creating Objects]].

## The Arithmetic Operators

The Java programming language provides operators that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There's a good chance you'll recognize them by their counterparts in basic mathematics. The only symbol that might look new to you is " `%` ", which divides one operand by another and returns the remainder as its result.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `+` | Additive operator (also used for String concatenation) |
| `-` | Subtraction operator |
| `*` | Multiplication operator |
| `/` | Division operator |
| `%` | Remainder operator |

The following program, [`ArithmeticDemo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/ArithmeticDemo.java), tests the arithmetic operators.

```
class ArithmeticDemo {

    public static void main (String[] args) {

        int result = 1 + 2;
        // result is now 3
        System.out.println("1 + 2 = " + result);
        int original_result = result;

        result = result - 1;
        // result is now 2
        System.out.println(original_result + " - 1 = " + result);
        original_result = result;

        result = result * 2;
        // result is now 4
        System.out.println(original_result + " * 2 = " + result);
        original_result = result;

        result = result / 2;
        // result is now 2
        System.out.println(original_result + " / 2 = " + result);
        original_result = result;

        result = result + 8;
        // result is now 10
        System.out.println(original_result + " + 8 = " + result);
        original_result = result;

        result = result % 7;
        // result is now 3
        System.out.println(original_result + " % 7 = " + result);
    }
}
```

This program prints the following:

```
1 + 2 = 3
3 - 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 + 8 = 10
10 % 7 = 3
```

You can also combine the arithmetic operators with the simple assignment operator to create *compound assignments*. For example, `x+=1;` and `x=x+1;` both increment the value of `x` by 1.

The `+` operator can also be used for concatenating (joining) two strings together, as shown in the following [`ConcatDemo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/ConcatDemo.java) program:

```
class ConcatDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        String firstString = "This is";
        String secondString = " a concatenated string.";
        String thirdString = firstString+secondString;
        System.out.println(thirdString);
    }
}
```

By the end of this program, the variable `thirdString` contains "This is a concatenated string.", which gets printed to standard output.

## The Unary Operators

The unary operators require only one operand; they perform various operations such as incrementing/decrementing a value by one, negating an expression, or inverting the value of a boolean.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `+` | Unary plus operator; indicates positive value (numbers are positive without this, however) |
| `-` | Unary minus operator; negates an expression |
| `++` | Increment operator; increments a value by 1 |
| `--` | Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1 |
| `!` | Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean |

The following program, [`UnaryDemo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/UnaryDemo.java), tests the unary operators:

```
class UnaryDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int result = +1;
        // result is now 1
        System.out.println(result);

        result--;
        // result is now 0
        System.out.println(result);

        result++;
        // result is now 1
        System.out.println(result);

        result = -result;
        // result is now -1
        System.out.println(result);

        boolean success = false;
        // false
        System.out.println(success);
        // true
        System.out.println(!success);
    }
}
```

The increment/decrement operators can be applied before (prefix) or after (postfix) the operand. The code `result++;` and `++result;` will both end in `result` being incremented by one. The only difference is that the prefix version (`++result`) evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version (`result++`) evaluates to the original value. If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose. But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.

The following program, [`PrePostDemo`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/examples/PrePostDemo.java), illustrates the prefix/postfix unary increment operator:

```
class PrePostDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        // prints 4
        System.out.println(i);
        ++i;               
        // prints 5
        System.out.println(i);
        // prints 6
        System.out.println(++i);
        // prints 6
        System.out.println(i++);
        // prints 7
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```
