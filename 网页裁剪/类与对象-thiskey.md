The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.  
See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.

## Using the this Keyword

Within an instance method or a constructor, `this` is a reference to the *current object* — the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can refer to any member of the current object from within an instance method or a constructor by using `this`.

## Using this with a Field

The most common reason for using the `this` keyword is because a field is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter.

For example, the `Point` class was written like this

```java
public class Point {
    public int x = 0;
    public int y = 0;
        
    //constructor
    public Point(int a, int b) {
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
}
```

but it could have been written like this:

```java
public class Point {
    public int x = 0;
    public int y = 0;
        
    //constructor
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

Each argument to the constructor shadows one of the object's fields — inside the constructor **`x`** is a local copy of the constructor's first argument. To refer to the `Point` field **`x`**, the constructor must use `this.x`.

## Using this with a Constructor

From within a constructor, you can also use the `this` keyword to call another constructor in the same class. Doing so is called an *explicit constructor invocation*. Here's another `Rectangle` class, with a different implementation from the one in the [[类与对象-objects|Objects]] section.

```java
public class Rectangle {
    private int x, y;
    private int width, height;
        
    public Rectangle() {
        this(0, 0, 1, 1);
    }
    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this(0, 0, width, height);
    }
    public Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    ...
}
```

This class contains a set of constructors. Each constructor initializes some or all of the rectangle's member variables. The constructors provide a default value for any member variable whose initial value is not provided by an argument. For example, the no-argument constructor creates a 1x1 `Rectangle` at coordinates 0,0. The two-argument constructor calls the four-argument constructor, passing in the width and height but always using the 0,0 coordinates. As before, the compiler determines which constructor to call, based on the number and the type of arguments.

If present, the invocation of another constructor must be the first line in the constructor.
