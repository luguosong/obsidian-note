The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.  
See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.

## Lock Objects

Synchronized code relies on a simple kind of reentrant lock. This kind of lock is easy to use, but has many limitations. More sophisticated locking idioms are supported by the [`java.util.concurrent.locks`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html) package. We won't examine this package in detail, but instead will focus on its most basic interface, [`Lock`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html).

`Lock` objects work very much like the implicit locks used by synchronized code. As with implicit locks, only one thread can own a `Lock` object at a time. `Lock` objects also support a `wait/notify` mechanism, through their associated [`Condition`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html) objects.

The biggest advantage of `Lock` objects over implicit locks is their ability to back out of an attempt to acquire a lock. The `tryLock` method backs out if the lock is not available immediately or before a timeout expires (if specified). The `lockInterruptibly` method backs out if another thread sends an interrupt before the lock is acquired.

Let's use `Lock` objects to solve the deadlock problem we saw in [[并发-liveness|Liveness]]. Alphonse and Gaston have trained themselves to notice when a friend is about to bow. We model this improvement by requiring that our `Friend` objects must acquire locks for *both* participants before proceeding with the bow. Here is the source code for the improved model, [`` `Safelock` ``](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/examples/Safelock.java). To demonstrate the versatility of this idiom, we assume that Alphonse and Gaston are so infatuated with their newfound ability to bow safely that they can't stop bowing to each other:

                    + " to bow to me, but saw that"
                    + " I was already bowing to"
                    + " him.%n",
