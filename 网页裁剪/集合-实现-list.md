## List Implementations

`List` implementations are grouped into general-purpose and special-purpose implementations.

## General-Purpose List Implementations

There are two general-purpose [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) implementations — [`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) and [`LinkedList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html). Most of the time, you'll probably use `ArrayList`, which offers constant-time positional access and is just plain fast. It does not have to allocate a node object for each element in the `List`, and it can take advantage of `System.arraycopy` when it has to move multiple elements at the same time. Think of `ArrayList` as `Vector` without the synchronization overhead.

If you frequently add elements to the beginning of the `List` or iterate over the `List` to delete elements from its interior, you should consider using `LinkedList`. These operations require constant-time in a `LinkedList` and linear-time in an `ArrayList`. But you pay a big price in performance. Positional access requires linear-time in a `LinkedList` and constant-time in an `ArrayList`. Furthermore, the constant factor for `LinkedList` is much worse. If you think you want to use a `LinkedList`, measure the performance of your application with both `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` before making your choice; `ArrayList` is usually faster.

`ArrayList` has one tuning parameter — the *initial capacity*, which refers to the number of elements the `ArrayList` can hold before it has to grow. `LinkedList` has no tuning parameters and seven optional operations, one of which is `clone`. The other six are `addFirst`, `getFirst`, `removeFirst`, `addLast`, `getLast`, and `removeLast`. `LinkedList` also implements the `Queue` interface.

## Special-Purpose List Implementations

[`CopyOnWriteArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html) is a `List` implementation backed up by a copy-on-write array. This implementation is similar in nature to `CopyOnWriteArraySet`. No synchronization is necessary, even during iteration, and iterators are guaranteed never to throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. This implementation is well suited to maintaining event-handler lists, in which change is infrequent, and traversal is frequent and potentially time-consuming.

If you need synchronization, a `Vector` will be slightly faster than an `ArrayList` synchronized with `Collections.synchronizedList`. But `Vector` has loads of legacy operations, so be careful to always manipulate the `Vector` with the `List` interface or else you won't be able to replace the implementation at a later time.

If your `List` is fixed in size — that is, you'll never use `remove`, `add`, or any of the bulk operations other than `containsAll` — you have a third option that's definitely worth considering. See `Arrays.asList` in the [Convenience Implementations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/convenience.html) section for more information.
