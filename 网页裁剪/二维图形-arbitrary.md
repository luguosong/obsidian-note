## Drawing Arbitrary Shapes

You have already learned how to draw most of shapes represented in the `java.awt.geom` package. To create more complicated geometry, such as polygons, polylines, or stars you use another class from this package, `GeneralPath`.

This class implements the [`Shape`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Shape.html) interface and represents a geometric path constructed from lines, and quadratic and cubic curves. The three constructors in this class can create the [`GeneralPath`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/geom/GeneralPath.html) object with the default winding rule (`WIND_NON_ZERO`), the given winding rule (`WIND_NON_ZERO` or `WIND_EVEN_ODD`), or the specified initial coordinate capacity. The winding rule specifies how the interior of a path is determined.

```
public void paint (Graphics g) {
    Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;
    ...
}
```

To create an empty `GeneralPath` instance call `new GeneralPath()` and then add segments to the shape by using the following methods:

- `moveTo(float x, float y)` – Moves the current point of the path to the given point
- `lineTo(float x, float y)` – Adds a line segment to the current path
- `quadTo(float ctrlx, float ctrly, float x2, floaty2)` – Adds a quadratic curve segment to the current path
- `curveTo(float ctrlx1, float ctrly1, float ctrlx2, float ctrly2, float x3, floaty3)` – Adds a cubic curve segment to the current path
- `closePath()` – Closes the current path

The following example illustrates how to draw a polyline by using `GeneralPath`:

```
// draw GeneralPath (polyline)
int x2Points[] = {0, 100, 0, 100};
int y2Points[] = {0, 50, 50, 0};
GeneralPath polyline = 
        new GeneralPath(GeneralPath.WIND_EVEN_ODD, x2Points.length);

polyline.moveTo (x2Points[0], y2Points[0]);

for (int index = 1; index < x2Points.length; index++) {
         polyline.lineTo(x2Points[index], y2Points[index]);
};

g2.draw(polyline);
```

This example illustrates how to draw a polygon by using `GeneralPath`:

```
// draw GeneralPath (polygon)
int x1Points[] = {0, 100, 0, 100};
int y1Points[] = {0, 50, 50, 0};
GeneralPath polygon = 
        new GeneralPath(GeneralPath.WIND_EVEN_ODD,
                        x1Points.length);
polygon.moveTo(x1Points[0], y1Points[0]);

for (int index = 1; index < x1Points.length; index++) {
        polygon.lineTo(x1Points[index], y1Points[index]);
};

polygon.closePath();
g2.draw(polygon);
```

Note that the only difference between two last code examples is the `closePath()` method. This method makes a polygon from a polyline by drawing a straight line back to the coordinates of the last `moveTo`.

To add a specific path to the end of your `GeneralPath` object you use one of the `append()` methods. The [`` `ShapesDemo2D.java` ``](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/geometry/examples/ShapesDemo2D.java) code example contains additional implementations of arbitrary shapes.
