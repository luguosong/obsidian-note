The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.  
See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.

## Defining an Applet Subclass

Every Java applet must define a subclass of the `Applet` or `JApplet` class. In the Hello World applet, this subclass is called `HelloWorld`. The following is the source for the [`` `HelloWorld` ``](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/examples/applet_HelloWorld/src/HelloWorld.java) class.

```
import javax.swing.JApplet;
import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;
import javax.swing.JLabel;

public class HelloWorld extends JApplet {
    //Called when this applet is loaded into the browser.
    public void init() {
        //Execute a job on the event-dispatching thread; creating this applet's GUI.
        try {
            SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() {
                public void run() {
                    JLabel lbl = new JLabel("Hello World");
                    add(lbl);
                }
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("createGUI didn't complete successfully");
        }
    }
}
```

Java applets inherit significant functionality from the `Applet` or `JApplet` class, including the capabilities to communicate with the browser and present a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user.

An applet that will be using GUI components from Swing (Java's GUI toolkit) should extend the [`javax.swing.JApplet`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JApplet.html) base class, which provides the best integration with Swing's GUI facilities.

`JApplet` provides a root pane, which is the same top-level component structure as Swing's `JFrame` and `JDialog` components, whereas `Applet` provides just a basic panel. See [How to Use Root Panes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/rootpane.html) for more details on how to use this feature.

An applet can extend the [`java.applet.Applet`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/applet/Applet.html) class when it does not use Swing's GUI components.
