The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.  
See [Dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.  
See [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=java_language_changes) for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.

## Structure of the JNLP File

This topic describes the syntax of the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) file for rich Internet applications (RIAs).

The following code snippet shows a sample JNLP file for a Java Web Start application:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jnlp spec="1.0+" codebase="" href="">
    <information>
        <title>Dynamic Tree Demo</title>
        <vendor>Dynamic Team</vendor>
        <icon href="sometree-icon.jpg"/>
        <offline-allowed/>
    </information>
    <resources>
        <!-- Application Resources -->
        <j2se version="1.6+" href=
           "http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se"/>
        <jar href="DynamicTreeDemo.jar"
            main="true" />

    </resources>
    <application-desc
         name="Dynamic Tree Demo Application"
         main-class="webstartComponentArch.DynamicTreeApplication"
         width="300"
         height="300">
     </application-desc>
     <update check="background"/>
</jnlp>
```

## Encoding JNLP Files

Java Web Start software supports encoding of JNLP files in any character encoding supported by the Java platform. For more information about character encoding in the Java platform, see the [Supported Encodings Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html). To encode a JNLP file, specify an encoding in the XML prolog of that file. For example, the following line indicates that the JNLP file is encoded in UTF-16.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
```

---

**Note:** The XML prolog itself must be UTF-8-encoded.
